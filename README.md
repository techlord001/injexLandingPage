> The Injex A-100 Programmable Syringe Pump by Lerkit is the Programmable Syringe Pump of choice for anyone who's anyone in the Programmable Syringe Pump-ing game ðŸ¤˜. 

Submitted as part of a competition the client requested a landing page to promote his up-coming product, placing specific caveats for the site including:
 * Being a single page only
 * Use of HTML, CSS and JS exclusively - this meant no use of libraries or frameworks
 * Had to include a contact button
 * Must be responsive to all devices

I decided to design the page using Sass (and by extension Webpack), employing CSS Grid for the layout with various defaults for responsive design. I also took the liberty of creating a working image gallery.
